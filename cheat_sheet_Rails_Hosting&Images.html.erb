.env is the file in the root of your project, where you store your environment variables (API credentials for instance).
It contains sensitive information you don’t want to share with anyone.
This file must be in your .gitignore file in order to make sure it won’t ever be
pushed on GitHub! Working as a team, you’ll have to share this file manually with your teammates.
