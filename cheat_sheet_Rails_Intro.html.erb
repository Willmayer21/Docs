<!-- What is Rails? -->
  - Rails is a fullstack framework designed for web-app development based on Ruby & MVC-structured.

<!-- Params holds the data sent by your users through a form -->

<!-- What is the Rails action/view convention? -->
  - The Rails action/view convention links a 
    controller’s action to 
    a specific view through 
    a naming convention

<!-- Install gems you added to your Gemfile -->
  - Kill any web server running (Ctrl + C)
  - Run bundle install
  - Restart the Rails server with rails s

<!-- Gem information -->
  - rubygems.org
  - GitHub

<!-- Action in Rails is a controller’s method targeted by a route -->

<!-- Define a route to a ‘contact’ static page with Rails -->
  # config/routes.rb
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      get 'contact' => 'pages#contact'
      # OR
      get 'contact', to: 'pages#contact'
    end

  rails routes
    # Prefix Verb URI Pattern             Controller#Action
    #contact GET  /contact(.:format)      pages#contact

<!-- Launch a local server with Rails -->
  - rails s
  - then go to localhost:3000 in your browser

<!-- Command allowing you to list your app’s routes with Rails -->
  - rails routes

  gives you:
    - Prefix is the rails path prefix of the associated route
    - Verb is the HTTP verb of the route
    - URI Pattern is the path of the route
    - Controller#Action are targeted controller and method

<!-- Build a PagesController -->
  - rails generate controller pages/controller_name
  - Note: This also generates the pages folder in app/views!

<!-- Build a link to an inner page in a Rails app -->
  - <%= link_to "contact", contact_path %>

<!-- Define a static page ‘home’ as homepage with Rails -->
  # config/routes.rb
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      root to: 'pages#home'
    end

  Results in:
    rails routes
      #Prefix Verb URI Pattern             Controller#Action
      #  root GET  /                       pages#home

<!-- Build the path to a page of a Rails app -->
  - Run rails routes in your terminal to know the prefix of the associated route
  - Append _path to the prefix and Rails builds the path

  # Example
    rails routes
    # Prefix Verb URI Pattern             Controller#Action
    #contact GET  /pages/contact          pages#contact
    #   root GET  /                       pages#home

    contact_path
    # => '/pages/contact'

<!-- Skip generating tests when creating a new Rails app -->
  - rails new app_name -T

<!-- The app folder contains most of the code of a Rails project (MVC + assets): -->
  - app
    |--assets
    |--controllers
    |--models
    |--views
