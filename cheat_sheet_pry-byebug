To use prybug, install it first in terminal:
gem install pry-byebug

require it at the top of your code:
require "pry-byebug"

Then, in your code add:
binding.pry

the execution will stop where binding.pry has been inserted. Once the program stops you can have a look at ANY variables you have at hand by typing them followed by enter.

You can continue the entire program until the next binding.pry by typing:
continue
continue execute the next line

by typing:
next
the following line in the code is executed

step is the abreviation for step in.
by typing: step
you can go in the fonction at hand. Use next to get out of step.

in the debugger, type help to have the entire command list available in pry-byebug.

3 key words:
continue - go until the next binding.pry or end of program
next - execute next line and stops
step - enter in the methode of the line

once you are done with degubing TAKE OUT the require at the top of the page and TAKE OUT all the binding.pry

if binding.pry used in each do.. the program will stop each time for each element.
